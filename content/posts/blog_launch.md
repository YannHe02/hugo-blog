# Launching my blog!

I figured I could start a little blog to write about a few things like tech, social media or maybe about completely different stuff.

This site is built with Hugo, an open source static site generator written in Go and currently hosted on GitHub pages.
I am planning to host this blog on a VPS on a personal site or something, but currently I don't use a VPS, nor do I have personal site, other than this blog now of course.

The configuration of this blog was definitely an exiperience, since this is the first time I'm using a static site generator.
Until now, I have only changed the theme to [Monochrome](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-monochrome/), adjusting the colors to use the theme of Catppuccin Macchiato for the dark mode and (not yet as I'm writing this) Catppuccin Latte for the light mode ([link to their site](https://catppuccin.com/)).

I don't know how frequent posts are gonna be here, I'll use this blog for now as some kind of documentation of the things I am currently doing, focusing on programming and Linux stuff probably.
